Perfect üëç ‚Äî since you have **4+ years frontend experience**, I‚Äôll give you a **2-week structured prep plan**.
Each day covers **theory + hands-on** (because security makes most sense when you *exploit and then defend*).

---

# üõ°Ô∏è 2-Week Frontend Security Prep Plan

## **Week 1 ‚Üí Core Web & Browser Security**

**Day 1: Security Fundamentals**

* **Read**: Same-Origin Policy (SOP), origins vs. domains vs. sites.
* **Hands-on**: Write two HTML files on different ports ‚Üí try accessing one‚Äôs DOM/cookies from another (see SOP in action).
* **Deep dive**: CORS: preflight, credentials, common misconfigs.

**Day 2: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

* **Read**: Stored vs. Reflected vs. DOM-based XSS.
* **Hands-on**: Run OWASP Juice Shop ‚Üí inject `<script>alert(1)</script>` into forms.
* **Frontend angle**: Learn how React auto-escapes, why `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is risky.

**Day 3: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**

* **Read**: How CSRF exploits cookies.
* **Hands-on**: Create a simple backend with a cookie-authenticated POST endpoint ‚Üí forge a request via hidden form in another page.
* **Mitigation**: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookie attribute.

**Day 4: Clickjacking + UI Redress Attacks**

* **Read**: Iframe overlays, click fraud.
* **Hands-on**: Embed a demo banking app inside an `<iframe>` with CSS opacity trick.
* **Mitigation**: `X-Frame-Options`, CSP `frame-ancestors`.

**Day 5: Authentication & Session Security**

* **Read**: JWT vs cookies for auth, refresh tokens, replay attacks.
* **Hands-on**: Build a tiny SPA ‚Üí store token in `localStorage` vs. `httpOnly cookie` ‚Üí try XSS to steal it.
* **Mitigation**: HttpOnly cookies, token rotation, PKCE in OAuth flows.

**Day 6: API Security (Frontend Angle)**

* **Read**: GraphQL security (query depth, batching abuse), REST misconfigs.
* **Hands-on**: Hit a GraphQL endpoint with deeply nested query ‚Üí see performance impact.
* **Mitigation**: query depth limiting, rate limiting (though mostly backend, but frontend should know failure modes).

**Day 7: Review + Mock Scenarios**

* Build a simple app with login, form submission, and iframe integration.
* Write down 5 attack vectors you can apply (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, token theft, misconfigured CORS).
* Try at least 2.

## **Week 2 ‚Üí Advanced, Modern & Framework Security**

**Day 8: CSP (Content Security Policy)**

* **Read**: How CSP blocks inline scripts, prevents XSS.
* **Hands-on**: Add a strict CSP ‚Üí see how it breaks inline event handlers (`onclick`).
* **Framework note**: Next.js has built-in CSP support.

**Day 9: Subresource Integrity + HSTS**

* **Read**: SRI for external scripts, HSTS for HTTPS-only.
* **Hands-on**: Load an external JS with wrong hash ‚Üí see how SRI blocks it.
* **Check**: Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Security tab to confirm HSTS.

**Day 10: Dependency & Supply Chain Attacks**

* **Read**: NPM typosquatting, malicious packages.
* **Hands-on**: Audit a React project with `npm audit` / Snyk.
* **Best practice**: lockfile management, CI/CD scanning.

**Day 11: Same-Origin Leaks (XS-Leaks)**

* **Read**: Timing attacks, pixel stealing, cache probing.
* **Hands-on**: Try `window.open` + timing to detect login state.
* **Mitigation**: `SameSite` cookies, opaque responses.

**Day 12: Framework-Specific Security**

* **React**: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, handling 3rd-party scripts, sanitization with DOMPurify.
* **Next.js/SSR**: Prevent SSRF when fetching data server-side.
* **Hands-on**: Add unsanitized HTML into a React component ‚Üí exploit with a script.

**Day 13: Monitoring & Runtime Defenses**

* **Read**: DOMPurify, runtime CSP, Sentry security monitoring.
* **Hands-on**: Integrate DOMPurify ‚Üí sanitize user-generated HTML input.
* **Practice**: Log suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed requests).

**Day 14: Mock Interview + Review**

* **Scenario practice**:

  * How would you secure an e-commerce checkout flow?
  * How do you protect a React SPA against XSS?
  * Why shouldn‚Äôt tokens be stored in localStorage?
* **Hands-on**: Walk through OWASP Top 10 and map each to a frontend mitigation.

## üéØ Output After 2 Weeks

* You‚Äôll have a **working mental model** for web attacks.
* You‚Äôll be able to **demonstrate exploits + mitigations** in interviews.
* You‚Äôll stand out as someone who not only knows theory but also real-world implications.
